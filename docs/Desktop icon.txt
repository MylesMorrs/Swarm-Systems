To make a desktop icon that can run a script it needs three parts:

    The code

    The Shell script

    and the Desktop Shortcut

For the code you need to know the location of it (Right click on file in file manager --> Properties --> look for "Parent folder" to the right of it should be the location "/home/..../..." )

The shell script:
    First step create the shell script. This file can be located anywhere (My recommendation is the same folder as the code).
    Run:
        cd /home/..../...
        nano name.sh
    Now that the file is created we need it to run the code. The shell script can be thought of a automated terminal. It will run one line after the other. 
    We want to get into the correct folder then run the code.
    Like: 
        cd /home/..../....
        python3 code.python

Desktop script:   
    Next we want to make the desktop shortcut. This is really just telling us where the shell script is located and running that when pressed. 
    We can tell the shell script to show the terminal. (Terminal=true) 
    Icon if we want it we just need to tell it the image location. (Icon=/..../..../image.png)
    We can name is with (Name= name of the application)
    The most important line is the Exec, this is the file location of the shell script. (Exec=/..../..../..../name.sh)


        [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Send Drone Command
    Comment=Launch MQTT GOTO Command
    Exec=/home/mcuser/Mother/scripts/run_swarm.sh
    Icon=/home/mcuser/Mother/assets/logo.png
    Terminal=true
    Type=Application
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Categories=Utility

Now use we need to make the files executables to make everything work, we need to run the following command with the correct file name for each of the files
executable command:
    cmod +x file.extension 


Lastly right click on the desktop icon and click "Allow Launching"
